project 1 
•	Create a Pivot Table to summarise the data by county and product.
•	Use the SWITCH function to categorise products based on their sales volume.


Dataset:
County	Product	Sales Volume
Yorkshire	Laptops	500
Yorkshire	Smartphones	200
Cornwall	Laptops	700
Cornwall	Printers	400
Lancashire	Smartphones	150
Lancashire	Laptops	600
Essex	Printers	800
Essex	Smartphones	300
Durham	Laptops	250
Durham	Printers	300
Greater Manchester	Smartphones	600
Greater Manchester	Laptops	400
Step 1: Create a Pivot Table
•	Select the dataset (columns A to C).
•	Insert a Pivot Table to summarise the data by County in the rows and Products in the columns. Use Sales Volume as the value to be summarised.
Step 2: Use the SWITCH Function
In a new column next to your data, use the SWITCH function to categorise products based on Sales Volume as follows:
o	For sales greater than 600: "High"
o	For sales between 300 and 600: "Medium"
o	For sales less than 300: "Low"
